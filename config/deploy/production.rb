# Files to link or copy into web root
# Symlinks are symlinked in

# wp_symlinks defaults to:
#  "cache" => "wp-content/cache"
#  "uploads" => "wp-content/uploads"
#  "blogs.dir" => "wp-content/blogs.dir"
#
# To override, set the target to nil:
#
#set :wp_symlinks, [{
#  "cache" => nil
#}]
#
# Or add other files:
#
#set :wp_symlinks, [{
#  "authcache" => "wp-content/authcache"
#}]
#
# Configs are copied in, and default to:
#  "db-config.php" => "/",
#  "advanced-cache.php" => "wp-content/",
#  "object-cache.php" => "wp-content/",
#  "*.html" => "/",
#
# To override (like wp_symlinks):
#set :wp_configs, [{
#}]
#
# Stage-specific overrides are copied from the config directory,
# like production-example.txt or staging-example.txt
# Default list:
#
#       "local-config.php" => "local-config.php",
#       ".htaccess" => ".htaccess"
#
# To override or add other files (as above, but note no []):
#
#set :stage_specific_overrides, {
#}
